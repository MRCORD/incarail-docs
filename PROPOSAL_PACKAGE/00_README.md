## 🎭 Competitive Dynamics

### David vs Goliath
| Operator | Passengers | Backing | Marketing Team | SEO Position |
|----------|-----------|---------|----------------|--------------|
| **PeruRail** | 675K (52%) | $92B LVMH | 40-50 people | ✅ **Better** (ranks for key terms) |
| **IncaRail** | 600K (48%) | PE-backed | 0 growth team | ❌ **Weaker** (rank #3,113) |

### The 12-18 Month Window
```
Month 0: IncaRail starts transformation (OR stays stuck)
   ↓
Month 6: PeruRail notices revenue gap
   ↓ (6-month LVMH approval cycle)
Month 12: PeruRail gets budget approval
   ↓ (IncaRail has 12-month head start IF they move)
Month 18: PeruRail launches digital initiatives
   ↓
OUTCOME: Who moved first wins permanently
```

**CRITICAL UPDATE**: PeruRail already has better SEO. If they add conversion optimization, window is **SHORTER**.
